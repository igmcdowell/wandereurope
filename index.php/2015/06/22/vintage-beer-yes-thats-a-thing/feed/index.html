		<description><![CDATA[All cantillon guezes are a blend of different aged lambics (I think Cantillon classic gueze uses a blend of 1, 2, and 3 year old lambics). If you had the Cantillon on draught there, that&#039;s what you had.

Akkurat also has a vintage beer list of beers that have been resting in the bottle for one or more years (in addition to that original blend of aged beers).  That&#039;s where I got the one in this post. You do have to specifically ask for the vintage list, it&#039;s not part of the regular menu.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you got to try a vintage one, Ian! And thanks for the recommendation. We went through next day and got a cantillon gueuze. Are all cantillon beers at Akkurat aged? I wonder how long the one we had was aged. It was the same as the one you had your first trip there.]]></description>
