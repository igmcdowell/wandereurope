										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have previously <a href="/index.php/2015/06/19/exploring-stockholm/">established</a> <a href="/index.php/2015/06/22/vintage-beer-yes-thats-a-thing/">that</a> <a href="/index.php/2015/06/27/lambic-off-framboise/">I</a> <a href="/index.php/2015/07/17/french-beer-update/">like</a> <a href="/index.php/2015/06/16/a-good-start/">Cantillon</a>. So visiting Brussels meant a mandatory trip to the fountainhead, Brasserie Cantillon.</p>
<p><span id="more-1104"></span></p>
<p>Unlike most breweries in Belgium, at Cantillon you can just show up and walk around on their &#8220;self guided tour.&#8221; 7 euros gets you a booklet, entrance to the brewery floor, and three ~6oz pours of lambic and geuze.</p>
<h3>Mash Tun</h3>
<div id="attachment_1120" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1120" class="wp-image-1120 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_mash_tun-1024x768.jpg" alt="mash tun at Cantillon brewery" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_mash_tun-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_mash_tun-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_mash_tun.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1120" class="wp-caption-text">The mash tun; this is where the magic starts</p></div>
<p>The first step in brewing is extracting sugar from your grains by soaking them in hot water; you&#8217;re essentially making a big &#8216;ol batch of grain tea.  Some beers aim to emphasize grain character and use lots of flavorful and/or roasted grains &#8211; think stouts and porters. Cantillon brews lambics, which are all about the yeast and bacteria (henceforth &#8220;bugs&#8221;).  The grain bill is composed of mild grains (wheat and barley) that won&#8217;t compete with the flavors being produced by the bugs.</p>
<p>The sugary liquid that comes out at the end of this step is known as wort.</p>
<h3>Brew Kettle</h3>
<div id="attachment_1119" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1119" class="wp-image-1119 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_brew_kettle-1024x768.jpg" alt="brew kettle at cantillon brewery" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_brew_kettle-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_brew_kettle-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_brew_kettle.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1119" class="wp-caption-text">The brew kettle</p></div>
<p>After you make your sugary wort, you need to boil it to sterilize the liquid to ensure you&#8217;re only adding the yeast and bacteria you want in your fermentation.</p>
<p>Boiling is also where you add your &#8220;boil addition&#8221; hops. Hops do three things to beer: (1) they have antibacterial properties that inhibit certain nasties from growing in the beer (2) they make the beer bitter, and (3) they impart flavor. Again, lambic is all about the bugs, so Cantillon uses hops that have been aged for 3 years to lose most of their aromatic flavors.</p>
<h3>Coolship</h3>
<div id="attachment_1118" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_coolship.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1118" class="wp-image-1118 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_coolship-1024x768.jpg" alt="Coolship at cantillon brewery" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_coolship-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_coolship-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_coolship.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1118" class="wp-caption-text">This is about half of the open inoculation vessel; it stretches right of frame</p></div>
<p>Nearly all beers are made by cooling down the wort and adding carefully selected yeast and bacteria in a sterile environment. Cantillon is not like most other beers. They employ a process known as &#8220;spontaneous fermentation.&#8221; In this case, they have a big shallow open-top copper dish in the attic that they pump the hot wort into. The high exposed surface area makes the wort cool down faster, and also lets in a bunch of yeast and bacteria from the air. These bugs will become the fermenters that turn the wort into beer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all random chance; because Cantillon has been brewing here for over 100 years, the rafters above the vessel host colonies of yeast and bacteria friendly to the brewing process.</p>
<h3>Fermentation</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1106" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_rafters-768x1024.jpg" alt="Beer barrels in the Cantillon brewery rafters" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_rafters-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_rafters-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_rafters.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1117" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_barrel_wall-768x1024.jpg" alt="wall of barrels at Cantillon brewery" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_barrel_wall-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_barrel_wall-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_barrel_wall.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Once the inoculated with wild bacteria and yeast, the proto-beer is pumped into wooden barrels. It is in these barrels that the yeast and bacteria will convert the sugar extracted from the grain into alcohol &#8211; the miracle of fermentation! Wild bugs tend to act slower than their commercial counterparts, but they are given plenty of time to do their job (3 years, at Cantillon). While most beers have some unfermented sugars left at the end, Cantillon&#8217;s are incredibly dry, with nearly all of the sugars converted to alcohol.</p>
<h3>Blending and Fruiting</h3>
<p>Once the lambic is ready, it can be put into bottles and shipped out to the world. The classic beer made from lambic is gueuze, a blend of 1, 2, and 3 year old lambic.</p>
<p>Cantillon also bottles beer that have had fresh fruit. When we were there they had just received a bunch of wine grapes that they were destemming for addition to the lambic.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1114" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_grape_separation-768x1024.jpg" alt="Separating grapes at Cantillon brewery" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_grape_separation-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_grape_separation-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_grape_separation.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<h3>Bottling and Labeling</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Cantillon fanboy like I am, the picture of a wall of Fou&#8217;foune will make you start salivating. Otherwise I guess it just looks like a lot of bottles:</p>
<div id="attachment_1107" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1107" class="wp-image-1107 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/foune_wall-768x1024.jpg" alt="Wall of bottles of Fou Foune and Cantillon brewery" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/foune_wall-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/foune_wall-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/foune_wall.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1107" class="wp-caption-text">I have seen the promised land</p></div>
<p>The labeling operation has that classic old factory look. Here you can see labels waiting to be applied to those lovely &#8216;foone bottles.</p>
<div id="attachment_1111" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/foune_labeling.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1111" class="wp-image-1111 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/foune_labeling-1024x768.jpg" alt="Labeling Fou Foune at Cantillon Brewerya" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/foune_labeling-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/foune_labeling-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/foune_labeling.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1111" class="wp-caption-text">Love the beer glass next to the bottling line. Gotta stay hydrated on the shift.</p></div>
<p>Again, limited audience that will be excited about these things, but OMG WTF FOUNE JÉROBOAM!</p>
<div id="attachment_1112" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_foune_magnums.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1112" class="wp-image-1112 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_foune_magnums-768x1024.jpg" alt="Magnums of Fou Foune at Cantillon brewery" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_foune_magnums-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_foune_magnums-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_foune_magnums.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1112" class="wp-caption-text">A jéroboam is 3 liters (twice the size of a magnum). Don&#8217;t worry, I had to look it up too.</p></div>
<h3>???</h3>
<div id="attachment_1115" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1115" class="wp-image-1115 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_IDK-1024x768.jpg" alt="mystery device at cantillon brewery" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_IDK-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_IDK-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_IDK.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1115" class="wp-caption-text">They called me mad at the academy. I&#8217;ll show them!</p></div>
<p>I saw this machine in the brewery. I have no idea what it is. It looks like something operated by a man with a white lab coat and unmanageable hair.</p>
<h3>Drinking</h3>
<p>The most important step in any brewing process. Cantillon has a lovely little space downstairs for enjoying the wonders on sale. In addition to a nice tap selection (lambic, geuze, kriek, and st gilloise for ~2.5 EUR), they also have bottles of rare and hard to find stuff.</p>
<div id="attachment_1109" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1109" class="wp-image-1109 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ian_pour_basket-1024x768.jpg" alt="Pouring Cantillon Carignan from a basket at the brewery" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ian_pour_basket-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ian_pour_basket-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ian_pour_basket.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1109" class="wp-caption-text">No, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing.</p></div>
<p>We started with the Carignan, a beer that has only been sold at the brewery itself. It&#8217;s a 2 year old single-barrel lambic with the addition of red wine grapes. Those grapes were front and center, definitely the most &#8220;wine-y&#8221; beer I have tasted. Just lovely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_cluster.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1110" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_cluster-1024x768.jpg" alt="Cantillon Carignan, Lou Pepe Framboise, and glasses of others" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_cluster-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_cluster-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cantillon_cluster.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ian_pour_basket.jpg"><br />
</a>We also got a bottle of the Lou Pepe Framboise (think juicy funky raspberries), and did some sharing with other tables to sample more of the goods. We also tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zwanze 2012, a lambic with organic rhubarb (?!). Bizarre stuff, lots of vegetal flavor. Still delicious.</li>
<li>Grand Cru Bruscella from 2012. This is an aged lambic that is not bottle conditioned (read: flat). The flavors were interesting, but totally flat beer is still a hard one for me.</li>
<li>Iris. A dry-hopped Cantillon that would be a great every day beer if you could find it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Buying</h3>
<p>Also a very important step. I got a case of the good juice. Now I just need to get it home.</p>
<div id="attachment_1108" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/backpack_key_feature.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1108" class="wp-image-1108 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/backpack_key_feature-768x1024.jpg" alt="Backpack with case of cantillon in it" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/backpack_key_feature-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/backpack_key_feature-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/10/backpack_key_feature.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1108" class="wp-caption-text">I still need to do a write-up on my excellent MEI Voyager pack, but the key take-away is it holds a case of Cantillon.</p></div>
<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>There is no reason not to go here if you are in Belgium. Even if you (*gasp*) don&#8217;t like sour beer, it&#8217;s a classic brewery that&#8217;s worth the visit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Blue Fox is a hotel bar. I point this out because hotels are places where all kinds of people go. Including the kinds of people who would order a Cosmopolitan, or a Midori Sour. Which is all to say that from the get-go, hotel bars are a little bit hamstrung by the need to pander to a broad range of clientele used to sucking down syrupy abominations.</p>
<p>Does the Blue Fox succeed in rising above in the face of this adversity? Read on to find out.</p>
<p><span id="more-1020"></span></p>
<h3>Desert Swizzle</h3>
<div id="attachment_1021" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_drink_1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1021" class="wp-image-1021 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_drink_1-1024x768.jpg" alt="blue_fox_drink_1" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_drink_1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_drink_1-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_drink_1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1021" class="wp-caption-text">I need to get one of these</p></div>
<p>First off, I love the presentation. Taking a sip through a metal straw while raising the drink through a long wooden handle made me feel like <a href="http://www.thelandofshadow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/OldTobyGandalf2.jpg">Gandalf smoking a pipe</a>.</p>
<p>The drink description sounded enticing. <em>Saffron gin, nut coffee, cardamom</em>.  Swizzle is usually going to describe something from the Tiki family; the Queens Park Swizzle is perhaps the most famous. The traditional swizzle stick is actually cut from a plant indigenous to the Carribean (cocktail nerds with more money than sense can even buy an <a href="http://www.cocktailkingdom.com/swizzle-stick">authentic swizzle stick</a> on the internet).</p>
<p>I came in expecting a clever concoction marrying the spices of the islands with a gin base and coffee accent. Instead I got a one-note coffee drink that was a little on the sweet side.  It wasn&#8217;t a bad drink, but it fell far short of its potential. That said, I&#8217;d still happily go drink one again to recapture that feeling of arcane wizardry.</p>
<h3>Clover Club</h3>
<div id="attachment_1022" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_drink_2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1022" class="wp-image-1022 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_drink_2-768x1024.jpg" alt="blue_fox_drink_2" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_drink_2-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_drink_2-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_drink_2.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1022" class="wp-caption-text">Lurking in the bottom of that liquid are &#8220;pearls&#8221; made of raspberry jelly</p></div>
<p>The Blue Fox menu is divided into two sections; reinterpretations of classics, and original drinks. The classic Clover Club is gin, lemon juice, and raspberry (plus egg white for texture). The menu listed the same ingredients (sans egg white). The drink showed up with a molecular gastronomy flourish of some &#8220;caviar&#8221; made of raspberry jam in some sweet liquor. It looked nice, but the caviar was hard to drink and just tasted like sugar. The drink underneath was similarly sweet, lacking sufficient citrus to balance it out, and with raspberry flavor barely in evidence. Without Tolkeinesque barware to save it, this drink was a miss.</p>
<h3>House Made Amaro</h3>
<div id="attachment_1023" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_menu_amaro.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1023" class="wp-image-1023 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_menu_amaro-768x1024.jpg" alt="blue_fox_menu_amaro" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_menu_amaro-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_menu_amaro-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blue_fox_menu_amaro.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1023" class="wp-caption-text">The origami menu is actually super cool</p></div>
<p>Before I talk about the glass of alcohol, let&#8217;s take a minute to admire the branding work. That adorable blue fox is actually a folded up drink list. After we declared our intention to pay, the bartender quickly folded the little critter out of what otherwise looked like a normal (if square) seasonal drink menu.  It was both unexpected and delightful, characteristics I wish they had applied to their drinks.</p>
<p>On to the little taster glass. We&#8217;d been chatting with the bartender a lot, and as with many places we&#8217;ve been, he comped us a little treat when we closed out our bill.  Apparently one of the two bartenders had a grandmother with an Amaro recipe, and they had a stock of the finished product behind the bar. This stuff was excellent. Every bit as good as any commercial bottling, better than most. Of the amari I&#8217;ve tried, it was closest in flavor to Nonino.</p>
<h3>The Verdict</h3>
<p>As I mentioned at the top, hotel bars have a real challenge; they need to put together drinks that look and sound impressive, while not doing too much to challenge the palates of the average guest. True to form, the presentation was great, but the cocktails we tasted were too sweet and one-note. It may be that we chose the wrong drinks &#8211; the bartender we talked with seemed knowledgable and capable, and the off-menu house-made amaro was straight up delicious.</p>
<p>If you do find yourself at the Blue Fox, it might be worth asking the bartender to make you something complex and not overly sweet. It might even work.</p>
<p>As for me, I&#8217;m not going back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we heard there was an Anonymous themed bar making solid drinks in Prague, we knew we had to go.</p>
<p><span id="more-967"></span></p>
<p>The menu was full of cool sounding drinks, but there were a mysterious four blank pages at the front. Our bartender explained the system; you have three options when you order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Order something off of the &#8220;regular&#8221; menu</li>
<li>Tell the bartender what you like and have them make you something</li>
<li>Order &#8220;The Key&#8221;, a rum based aperitif that opens the door to the secret menu.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tiara and her mom Barbara ordered off of the regular menu, and I got a key. I&#8217;m a sucker for bar gimmicks.</p>
<h3>Muay Thai</h3>
<p>Tiara won at ordering again. I should just get what she gets. In this case, it was a thai inspired Mai Tai, served in a Guy Fawkes mask Tiki glass (!!!).</p>
<div id="attachment_969" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_guy_fawkes_tiki_mug.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-969" class="wp-image-969 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_guy_fawkes_tiki_mug-768x1024.jpg" alt="Muay Thai from Anonymous bar in Prague, served in Guy Fawkes mask tiki mug" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_guy_fawkes_tiki_mug-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_guy_fawkes_tiki_mug-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_guy_fawkes_tiki_mug.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-969" class="wp-caption-text">Anonymous officially won at Tiki mugs.</p></div>
<p>This drink was perfect. Rum, thai brandy, thai spice infused falernum, coconut syrup, orange liquer, and lime. It succeeded as a Mai Tai, but also had this great thai flavor profile that is hard to describe.  Definitely some thai basil, kaffir lime leaf, and maybe lemongrass.  Add in the most amazing custom tiki mug I have seen, and you&#8217;re looking at a world class drink.</p>
<h3>St Marry&#8217;s Virus</h3>
<p>This drink was not our favorite in taste.  But the presentation gets 5 1/2 stars.  The bartender brought our round of drinks, save that Barbara just got an empty glass. I joked it was &#8220;the world&#8217;s dryest martini&#8221;, but it turned out the beverage was on the way:</p>
<div id="attachment_968" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_guy_fawkes_virus_drink1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-968" class="wp-image-968 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_guy_fawkes_virus_drink1-768x1024.jpg" alt="bartender wearing anonymous mask serves drink from needle" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_guy_fawkes_virus_drink1-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_guy_fawkes_virus_drink1-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_guy_fawkes_virus_drink1.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-968" class="wp-caption-text">There it is, world&#8217;s creepiest drink service</p></div>
<p>A bartender wearing a Guy Fawkes mask showed up table-side carrying a small kit with a biohazard stamp. Inside were two needles filled with green fluid. Here you can see him dispensing the first.</p>
<p>Sadly, the flavors didn&#8217;t hold up to the awesome presentation. It was a little bland. Ingredients were gin, aperitif wine, melon liquer, and a dash of absinthe. I tasted none of those things (save for a hint of melon). Tiara described it as &#8220;bubble gum&#8221;, I just thought it was sweet and on the bland side.  Not sure what they were using for the gin, but clearly something skewing toward vodka. Not unpalatable, but just not standing out in any way.</p>
<h3>The Key</h3>
<p>I forgot to take a picture of The Key. It was basically a mix of spice infused rum and aperitif wine served in a small wine glass. It was nicely done, good balance of flavors, if a little sweet. I think it would have made an excellent Falernum on its own. The important part is the little gadget that came with the drink; a small, squeeze activated blacklight flashlight. Remember the mysteriously blank menu pages? Invisible ink baby!</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_invisible_ink_menu_1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-970" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_invisible_ink_menu_1-768x1024.jpg" alt="Invisible ink menu at anonymous bar in Prague read by blacklight" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_invisible_ink_menu_1-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_invisible_ink_menu_1-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_invisible_ink_menu_1.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So of course, we had to do another round off of the secret menu, now that we could read it.</p>
<h3>Op: Japan</h3>
<p>This one was a good riff on the classic highball. Japanese whisky, soda water, plus plum bitters and a house made plum syrup.</p>
<div id="attachment_971" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_japan.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-971" class="wp-image-971 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_japan-768x1024.jpg" alt="anonymous_op_japan" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_japan-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_japan-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_japan.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-971" class="wp-caption-text">Like all good haibōru, this one has perfectly clear ice</p></div>
<p>I thought they did a really nice job on this one. You got good whisky flavor, with some nice plum notes dancing around it. It was just a tad on the sweet side (it&#8217;s hard to add any kind of syrup to a highball), but not so much that I didn&#8217;t enjoy the hell out of it.</p>
<h3>Op: Malaysia</h3>
<p>This was Tiara&#8217;s drink; Rum, housemade tropical jam, eggwhite, and ango.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_malaysia.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-972" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_malaysia-768x1024.jpg" alt="anonymous_op_malaysia" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_malaysia-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_malaysia-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_malaysia.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a>Tiara&#8217;s initial comment is that it drank a lot like a Pisco sour. The tropical jam was a little muted in the background, but present if you looked for it. Another competent and tasty tipple.</p>
<h3>Op: Czech Prohibition</h3>
<p>This might have been the best we tried off of the secret menu.</p>
<div id="attachment_973" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_czech_prohibition.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-973" class="wp-image-973 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_czech_prohibition-768x1024.jpg" alt="anonymous_op_czech_prohibition" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_czech_prohibition-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_czech_prohibition-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/anonymous_op_czech_prohibition.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-973" class="wp-caption-text">That cool elevated stand is actually a modified DVD.</p></div>
<p>Slivovitz has a bad reputation, but man was it good in this drink. A really nice sour with lime, gin, slivovitz, plum jam, and &#8220;bohemian cordial&#8221; (becherovka maybe?).  Everything was in excellent balance, and gave a really nice expression of a couple aspects of plum.</p>
<h3>The Verdict</h3>
<p>If the drinks had been crappy, I would still recommend going to Anonymous Bar for the service and presentation alone. But the drinks weren&#8217;t crappy. Several of them were outstanding. I can wholeheartedly recommend this bar as a great spot to visit in Prague&#8217;s Old Town.  I&#8217;ll leave you with an IV bag presentation I snapped from the table next to us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I keep wanting to call this place Beckett&#8217;s Kampf. Kampf means &#8220;struggle&#8221; (as made memorable by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf">certain infamous book</a>). Kopf, on the other hand, means &#8220;head.&#8221; Here is the sign from Beckett&#8217;s Kopf. Maybe it will help me remember the distinction:</p>
<div id="attachment_855" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_sign.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-855" class="wp-image-855 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_sign-1024x768.jpg" alt="becketts_kopf_sign" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_sign-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_sign-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_sign.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-855" class="wp-caption-text">In my defense, Beckett looks like he&#8217;s been through a lot</p></div>
<p><span id="more-868"></span></p>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="/index.php/2015/08/23/berlin-cocktails-lost-in-grub-street/">previous post</a>, Beckett&#8217;s Kopf is owned by the same party as Lost in Grub Street. Though Lost in Grub Street went a little weird, Beckett&#8217;s Kopf has been tuning their game since opening in 2004, which is practically the epoch of the craft cocktail scene. Unsurprisingly they nail the classic speakeasy vibe.  And like any good speakeasy, it was &#8220;stumble into the wall&#8221; dark in there. So photos are on the grainy side.</p>
<div id="attachment_859" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beckets_kompf_drink_1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-859" class="wp-image-859 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beckets_kompf_drink_1-1024x768.jpg" alt="beckets_kopf_drink_1" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beckets_kompf_drink_1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beckets_kompf_drink_1-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beckets_kompf_drink_1.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-859" class="wp-caption-text">Times of Cascara, served in fancy bone china.</p></div>
<p>First off, they had a good esoteric &#8220;wow&#8221; factor. One of the ingredients in the Times of Cascara is &#8220;a tea from the fruit of a coffee cherry.&#8221;  I had never had anything made with the outside of coffee, and now I want more of it. Add in some cognac and batavia arrack, and it was a complex sipper. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of Earl Grey in the morning, but Times of Cascara may well change breakfast forever.</p>
<div id="attachment_858" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beckets_kompf_drink_2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-858" class="wp-image-858 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beckets_kompf_drink_2-768x1024.jpg" alt="beckets_kopf_drink_2" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beckets_kompf_drink_2-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beckets_kompf_drink_2-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/beckets_kompf_drink_2.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-858" class="wp-caption-text">The Knickerbocker, a &#8220;prehistoric mai tai&#8221;</p></div>
<p>I should mention that the menu was all in German, so we were shooting in the (literal and figurative) dark. Tiara went for the Knickerbocker, based on reading the words &#8220;Mai Tai&#8221; and &#8220;berries.&#8221;  It drank more like a sour than a Mai Tai, but was still well balanced and delicious.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_drink_3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-857" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_drink_3-768x1024.jpg" alt="becketts_kopf_drink_3" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_drink_3-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_drink_3-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_drink_3.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Now that we had the bartender&#8217;s ear, we were able to get advice on our next drinks. I went with the Ford, essentially a genever martini infused with wormwood and a lemon twist. Delicious. I&#8217;m a big fan of genever, it&#8217;s got a more nuanced complexity than it&#8217;s modern juniper driven cousin, and is the main component in my second favorite long drink, the <a href="http://savoystomp.com/2011/05/23/john-collins/">John Collins</a>.</p>
<p><em>Side note: most modern bars make their John Collins with bourbon. This is wrong. Those of you lucky enough to live in San Francisco can go to Comstock Saloon to get one done right. </em></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_drink_4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-856" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_drink_4-768x1024.jpg" alt="becketts_kopf_drink_4" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_drink_4-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_drink_4-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/becketts_kompf_drink_4.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a>Tiara got the Lusitanian, a mix of Portuguese brandy, tawny port and cherry liquer.  The net effect had a lot in common with a manhattan, which is probably what they&#8217;re going for with the name; Lusitania was a Roman province in what is now Portugal.</p>
<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>This was our favorite cocktail spot in Berlin. Beckett&#8217;s Kopf strikes the right balance of making unique drinks with a decent atmosphere. Not having to fight for a seat was also a big plus.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t the mind-melting perfection of Le Syndicat in Paris, but it was every bit as good as our favorite bars at home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lost in Grub Street is a weird bar with a weird name in Berlin&#8217;s business district. It was literally empty when we got there at 8PM on a Saturday; the bartender had to follow us in (he was sitting outside). He blamed &#8220;weekends in the summer,&#8221; which to me seem like good times to be in the bar business, but maybe things are different in Berlin (?)</p>
<p>The theme of the bar is &#8220;big bowls and short drinks.&#8221; Being as how there are only two of us, we skipped the punch bowls.</p>
<div id="attachment_846" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_drinks.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-846" class="wp-image-846 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_drinks-1024x768.jpg" alt="lost_in_grub_street_drinks" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_drinks-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_drinks-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_drinks.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-846" class="wp-caption-text">Bonus points for the double-wide cocktail napkin to accommodate the palate cleansing water.</p></div>
<p><span id="more-866"></span></p>
<p>There was a fair amount of esotericism going on here. To start with, the bar had a &#8220;pre-American&#8221; theme. Punch predates the modern bar-with-bartender-behind-it (an American invention), so Lost in Grub Street eschews the fixed bar in favor of a roving liquor cart. Or at least that&#8217;s what the bartender told us. My guess is they couldn&#8217;t figure out a way to make a bar fit in the big narrow space.</p>
<div id="attachment_847" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-847" class="wp-image-847 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_cart-768x1024.jpg" alt="lost_in_grub_street_cart" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_cart-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_cart-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_cart.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-847" class="wp-caption-text">The bartender wheeled that jalopy table-side to prepare our drinks as we watched.</p></div>
<p>The <a href="http://lostingrubstreet.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/karte_lost_in_grub_street.pdf">menu</a> was also frustratingly opaque. Rather than write out the ingredients, Lost in Grub Street chooses to list flavors (in German, of course). The bartender was very accommodating, but it&#8217;s no fun needing to ask what&#8217;s in every drink on the menu.  Near as I can tell they also weren&#8217;t using fresh citrus in any of the short drinks, putting them firmly in the spiritous family of cocktails.</p>
<p>We settled on Mandarine–Walnuss–Nelke (Ian) and Pflaume–Port–Zimt (Tiara). My drink had cognac, a local walnut liquer, and pierre ferrand triple sec. Tiara&#8217;s was madeira, a local plum liquer, and cinnamon tincture.  They were competently prepared, and flavors were generally good. Nothing blew our mind, and we settled up after the first drink.</p>
<p>I did get snipped at by the bartender for asking what one of the bottles was as he was adding it to the drink; &#8220;<em>I vill show you at ze end!&#8221;</em> To his credit, he did line the bottles up after mixing the drink for my benefit. He also refilled our water after every sip. I guess service was in keeping with the bar&#8217;s theme; studiously observant and a little stilted.</p>
<p>The owners of this bar also run Beckett&#8217;s Kopf, which is in a &#8220;hip&#8221; neighborhood outside of the center. A review is forthcoming; keep an eye out for the comparison.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We couldn&#8217;t help it; after the<a href="/index.php/2015/06/29/paris-bars-iii-le-syndicat/"> incredible drinks from our first trip</a>, we went back for more at the best bar in Paris.</p>
<div id="attachment_537" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/syndicate_bramble.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-537" class="size-large wp-image-537" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/syndicate_bramble-1024x768.jpg" alt="Le Syndicat C4 cocktail" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/syndicate_bramble-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/syndicate_bramble-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/syndicate_bramble.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-537" class="wp-caption-text">The C4. Now that&#8217;s my kind of breakfast.</p></div>
<p><span id="more-536"></span></p>
<p>The C4 was a suped up V8; I&#8217;m assuming that&#8217;s what they were going for with the name. It&#8217;s carrot juice, celery juice, citrus, gin, honey-pepper syrup, and a little bit of magic. I don&#8217;t generally go for the savory vegetable drinks (no thanks Bloody Mary), but I&#8217;ll make an exception for this one.</p>
<div id="attachment_538" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/syndicate_c4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-538" class="wp-image-538 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/syndicate_c4-1024x768.jpg" alt="Le Syndicate bramble cocktail" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/syndicate_c4-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/syndicate_c4-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/syndicate_c4.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-538" class="wp-caption-text">Have it your way. The bramble comes with a shot of cassis on the side, so you can get just the right amount of berry flavor.</p></div>
<p>The bramble is another riff on a classic. They substitute genever for dry gin and add gentian liqueur.  It&#8217;s a lovely fruity refreshing drink on a hot summer day, with a little extra complexity from the changes.</p>
<p>We also had to go back for another smoking car. I snapped a video of the alchemy when the sidecar hits the orange peel smoke:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was one of our favorite spots in Paris.  Unlike the other bars I&#8217;ve reviewed, A La Française operates on the traditional bistro model; outdoor cafe seating, a limited drink list, and full menu of delicious food.  A second bar downstairs has a larger selection of bottles and stiffer drinks. I&#8217;ll cover it all.</p>
<p><span id="more-524"></span></p>
<h3>Drinks</h3>
<div id="attachment_526" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_drinks.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-526" class="wp-image-526 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_drinks-1024x768.jpg" alt="Green Beast and  Sazerac at a La Françiase" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_drinks-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_drinks-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_drinks.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-526" class="wp-caption-text">Sazerac (left) and Green Beast (right)</p></div>
<p>The cafe portion (upstairs) focuses on aperitifs. They stock exclusively French spirits, and get creative with their menu. The &#8220;Sazerac&#8221; is made using cognac instead of bourbon (plus numerous other tweaks), and the Green Beast is an absinthe drink invented by a famous French bartender.</p>
<p>We chatted a lot with Tristan, one of the bartenders, who was super excited about the craft.  These guys are very into tradition; they even have an original Jerry Thomas Bartender&#8217;s Guide from 1862. While they share the same French-only focus as <a href="/index.php/2015/06/29/paris-bars-iii-le-syndicat/">Le Syndicat</a>, A La Française focuses on the traditional craft of cocktails, avoiding the molecular gastronomy/mad scientist style work at Le Syndicat.</p>
<p>Tristan shared a lot of both knowledge as well as samples of some of the ingredients they use:</p>
<div id="attachment_525" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_bottles.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-525" class="wp-image-525 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_bottles-1024x768.jpg" alt="Elderflower Liqueur and Strawberry Liquer" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_bottles-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_bottles-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_bottles.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-525" class="wp-caption-text">Strawberry Liquor (left), and Elderflower (right). Despite appearances, these are super solid liqueurs. I strongly prefer the elderflower to the more famous Saint Germain.</p></div>
<p>Prices are incredibly reasonable; happy hour is €6-7, which makes them about half the price of other top tier drinks in the city.  There is also a downstairs lounge bar open during nights only.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a downstairs bar that I didn&#8217;t succeed in getting good pictures of. It&#8217;s more loungy and has the club lights, as you can see in this snap of an incredibly awesome rum Tristan shared with us:</p>
<div id="attachment_528" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1641.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-528" class="wp-image-528 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1641-768x1024.jpg" alt="Trois Rivieres 2001 Rhum Agricole" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1641-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1641-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1641.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-528" class="wp-caption-text">Vintage single cask French rum. Yes please.</p></div>
<p>The highlight from downstairs was the house Old Fashioned, which again was an all French adaptation of the American classic. Sadly I neglected to take a photo, but I encourage you to go take one for me.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>We came for the drinks, and happened to be hungry on one of our return visits. Lucky us, the food was outstanding. I already posted about their epic hamburger, but here it is again:</p>
<div id="attachment_287" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1637.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-287" class="size-large wp-image-287" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1637-768x1024.jpg" alt="Burger from A La Francaise" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1637-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1637-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_1637.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-287" class="wp-caption-text">Tastes like Freedom&#8230;. and surrender. It&#8217;s confusing.</p></div>
<p>I just can&#8217;t say enough good things about that burger. Gravy, shredded potatoes, tomatoes, perfectly cooked ground beef, and french cheese to top it off. Best burger I&#8217;ve had in any restaurant.</p>
<p>A friend got the fish of the day (trout) which was also delicious.</p>
<div id="attachment_527" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_burger.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-527" class="wp-image-527 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_burger-1024x768.jpg" alt="Fish of the day (trout) at a la francaise" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_burger-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_burger-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/a_la_burger.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-527" class="wp-caption-text">Tasty whole trout with side of veggies</p></div>
<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>You should absolutely go here while in Paris, preferably around lunch or dinner. Get the burger. Start with the Eau Fraiche, or the Caïpi Byrrh if you want something fruity.  Then put yourself in the hands of the more than competent bartenders.</p>
<p>The bistro is just a <a href="https://www.google.fr/maps/dir/A+La+Fran%C3%A7aise,+Rue+L%C3%A9on+Frot,+Paris/P%C3%A8re+Lachaise+Cemetery,+16+Rue+du+Repos,+75020+Paris/@48.8582614,2.3846149,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x47e66df59cbd0949:0xf4b6ec46363da74d!2m2!1d2.3863188!2d48.8560707!1m5!1m1!1s0x47e66d8b5c69a785:0xa1cf6127530b6419!2m2!1d2.3933276!2d48.861393!3e2?hl=en">10 minute walk from Pere Lachaise Cemetery</a>, which you are probably visiting anyway.  So really you have no excuse not to go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rum is having a moment in Paris, and Mabel is at the center of it. I&#8217;ll get into the review in a moment, but first I have to rant a little about rum.</p>
<p><span id="more-500"></span>Let&#8217;s start with what isn&#8217;t rum. Bacardi is not rum, at least not the kind of rum I care about.  It&#8217;s flavorless sugar-alcohol masquerading as one of the world&#8217; great spirits.</p>
<p>Good rum is bursting with flavors, ranging from the fresh grassy herbaceous quality of a <a href="http://www.klwines.com/p/i?s=14EA406424E8&amp;i=1166017">rhum agricole</a> to the rotten fruit and burnt tire of a <a href="http://www.klwines.com/p/i?s=14EA406BA46B&amp;i=1052125">dank jamaican pot still rum</a>.  It&#8217;s also a bargain; a decent XO cognac will set you back at least $80, but you can get <a href="http://www.klwines.com/p/i?s=14EA4010FFF5&amp;i=1028171">a killer 12 year old sipper rum for $30</a>.  (Note: All links go to K&amp;L wines, sorry if you don&#8217;t live in California).</p>
<p>So yes, rum is awesome, but why is it so big in Paris? Are they growing sugar cane in France? Actually, yes. Thanks to the miracle of colonialism, there is a little patch of French soil smack in the middle of the Caribbean; the island of Martinique.  French people like their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellation_d%27origine_contr%C3%B4l%C3%A9e">AOC stamps</a>, and they created AOC Martinique Rhum Agricole to protect the particular style of rum made on the island. It&#8217;s an agricole, which means it is made from fermented fresh sugar cane instead of the typical molasses base.  If you&#8217;ve ever tried Cachaça or something from Barbancourt you&#8217;ve had a rum in this style.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve bored everyone with rum education, let&#8217;s get on to the drinks.</p>
<h3>Monk&#8217;s Swizzle</h3>
<h3><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-502" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel1-768x1024.jpg" alt="Monk's Swizzle from Mable" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel1-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel1-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel1.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h3>
<p>I was intrigued by this one. The primary spirits are Wray and Nephew Green Chartreuse, and Becherovka  Green Chartreuse is a famous French spirit made by Carthusian monks. It&#8217;s strong (55% ABV) and herbaceous (130 different herbs are infused into it), which gives it the potential to overpower a cocktail. Wray and Nephew is one of those big overproof funky Jamaican rums, and Becherovka is another herb driven spirit.  Put them all together and what do you get? A surprisingly tiki tasting concoction that goes down way too easy consider all the overproof juice in it.</p>
<h3>Trader Who?</h3>
<p>Tiara got this one, a riff on the classic Mai Tai, which was ostensibly invented at Trader Vic&#8217;s in Oakland in the 40s.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-503" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel2-1024x768.jpg" alt="Trader Who cocktail from Mabel" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel2-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel2.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>As Mai Tais go, this was as good as it gets. Lots of complex rum, creamy mouthfeel from the orgeat, and some well made curaçao to round it out, there&#8217;s nothing to complain about here.</p>
<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>If you like rum, you should go to Mabel. If you don&#8217;t like rum, you should go to Mabel so they can change your mind. If you don&#8217;t care about rum, get the hell off my blog.</p>
<p>The one downside is the interior was distinctly tropical. Not in the &#8220;full of cute tiki elements&#8221; kind of way, but in the &#8220;humid and 110 degrees&#8221; kind of way. Again, it&#8217;s a heatwave in Paris, but I recommend saving Mable for a day that&#8217;s a little on the chilly side.</p>
<p>Finally, for you serious nerds that want to noodle on the recipes, here&#8217;s the menu.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel_meu.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-501" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel_meu-1024x768.jpg" alt="Mabel Paris Menu" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel_meu-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel_meu-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel_meu.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mabel1.jpg"><br />

<p>Lulu White is a really neat spot; they&#8217;re doing three things I&#8217;ve never seen from another cocktail bar.</p>
<p><span id="more-479"></span></p>
<h3>1. No Citrus</h3>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but it&#8217;s totally insane. There are fundamentally two kinds of drinks in the modern bar cannon: citrus driven (think daquiris, sours, margaritas) and spirituous (old fashioneds, manhattans, rob roys, etc.). Every cocktail bar worth its salt juices a bunch of fresh limes and lemons before service to handle the citrus side of the menu.</p>
<p>Every bar, that is, except Lulu White. They still makes drinks with sour components, they just drive them with house-made fermented syrups and shrubs &#8211; essentially fancy vinegars. We tried a pair of drinks in this category and they were both outstanding. Fresh, tangy, and balanced, all without touching citrus. Impressive work.</p>
<div id="attachment_481" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_round_1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-481" class="wp-image-481 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_round_1-768x1024.jpg" alt="Jade Terminus Oxygenee and Mango Melt on Tango Belt" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_round_1-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_round_1-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_round_1.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-481" class="wp-caption-text">Jade Terminus Oxygenee (near) gets sour flavor from fermented pineapple. Mango Melt on Tango Belt (far) uses a mango shrub</p></div>
<p>The bartender gave us a sample of the fermented pineapple syrup and it was delicious. Not as sour as a shrub, but tangy and complex.</p>
<h3>2. Every Drink Has Absinthe</h3>
<p>Every, single, drink.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_menu.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-485" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_menu-1024x768.jpg" alt="Menu from Lulu White" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_menu-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_menu-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_menu.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a>This is also a crazy challenge for a bar to take on. Absinthe has a lot of weird lore around it, but the key takeaway is that it is an herb infused liquor that typically has a heavy anise flavor. It&#8217;s incredibly easy for absinthe to overpower a drink, and cocktails that utilize it well are legendary &#8211; try my favorite, the <a href="http://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/593/corpse-reviver-no2-1-savoy-recipe">Corpse Reviver #2</a>! Building a full, diverse with distinctive drinks that all incorporate absinthe is a world class accomplishment, even without the citrus handicap.</p>
<h3>3. They have  a Kombucha Program!</h3>
<div id="attachment_482" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_round_2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-482" class="size-large wp-image-482" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_round_2-1024x768.jpg" alt="Prima's Paradiscia and Denial Is Not a River in Egypt" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_round_2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_round_2-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white_round_2.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-482" class="wp-caption-text">Denial Is Not a River in Egypt (right) pairs house made Kombucha with cognac and dill. Prima&#8217;s Paradiscia is just a generally solid rum drink</p></div>
<p>I asked the bartender about the nasty looking jar with bubbling muck on top. He explained that they have a house <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kombucha">kombucha</a> culture that they are continually brewing from.  It&#8217;s basically like a sourdough starter: they make a batch, strain out the bacteria/yeast raft, add new sugar water, and repeat. Again, the bartender gave us samples of the raw ingredients. The tea they&#8217;re using has a delightful smoky flavor. I&#8217;d buy it if they sold the stuff, and I&#8217;m not generally a fan of fermented tea beverage.</p>
<h3>The Verdict</h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-484" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white2-768x1024.jpg" alt="Paper reading &quot;Lulu Welcomes You&quot; with picture of lulu" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white2-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white2-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lulu_white2.jpg 1152w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>This bar was awesome. The staff were super friendly in explaining the drinks and ingredients. Cocktails were inventive and the self-imposed constraints led to some very different tasting concoctions.</p>
<p>While Lulu White did not have the best drinks I tried in Paris (that honor goes to Le Syndicat), they were delicious, and the mad-scientist level of inventiveness is worth a visit in itself.</p>
