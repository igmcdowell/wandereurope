										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lost in Grub Street is a weird bar with a weird name in Berlin&#8217;s business district. It was literally empty when we got there at 8PM on a Saturday; the bartender had to follow us in (he was sitting outside). He blamed &#8220;weekends in the summer,&#8221; which to me seem like good times to be in the bar business, but maybe things are different in Berlin (?)</p>
<p>The theme of the bar is &#8220;big bowls and short drinks.&#8221; Being as how there are only two of us, we skipped the punch bowls.</p>
<div id="attachment_846" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_drinks.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-846" class="wp-image-846 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_drinks-1024x768.jpg" alt="lost_in_grub_street_drinks" width="640" height="480" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_drinks-1024x768.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_drinks-500x375.jpg 500w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_drinks.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-846" class="wp-caption-text">Bonus points for the double-wide cocktail napkin to accommodate the palate cleansing water.</p></div>
<p><span id="more-866"></span></p>
<p>There was a fair amount of esotericism going on here. To start with, the bar had a &#8220;pre-American&#8221; theme. Punch predates the modern bar-with-bartender-behind-it (an American invention), so Lost in Grub Street eschews the fixed bar in favor of a roving liquor cart. Or at least that&#8217;s what the bartender told us. My guess is they couldn&#8217;t figure out a way to make a bar fit in the big narrow space.</p>
<div id="attachment_847" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-847" class="wp-image-847 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_cart-768x1024.jpg" alt="lost_in_grub_street_cart" width="640" height="853" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_cart-768x1024.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_cart-375x500.jpg 375w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lost_in_grub_street_cart.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><p id="caption-attachment-847" class="wp-caption-text">The bartender wheeled that jalopy table-side to prepare our drinks as we watched.</p></div>
<p>The <a href="http://lostingrubstreet.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/karte_lost_in_grub_street.pdf">menu</a> was also frustratingly opaque. Rather than write out the ingredients, Lost in Grub Street chooses to list flavors (in German, of course). The bartender was very accommodating, but it&#8217;s no fun needing to ask what&#8217;s in every drink on the menu.  Near as I can tell they also weren&#8217;t using fresh citrus in any of the short drinks, putting them firmly in the spiritous family of cocktails.</p>
<p>We settled on Mandarine–Walnuss–Nelke (Ian) and Pflaume–Port–Zimt (Tiara). My drink had cognac, a local walnut liquer, and pierre ferrand triple sec. Tiara&#8217;s was madeira, a local plum liquer, and cinnamon tincture.  They were competently prepared, and flavors were generally good. Nothing blew our mind, and we settled up after the first drink.</p>
<p>I did get snipped at by the bartender for asking what one of the bottles was as he was adding it to the drink; &#8220;<em>I vill show you at ze end!&#8221;</em> To his credit, he did line the bottles up after mixing the drink for my benefit. He also refilled our water after every sip. I guess service was in keeping with the bar&#8217;s theme; studiously observant and a little stilted.</p>
<p>The owners of this bar also run Beckett&#8217;s Kopf, which is in a &#8220;hip&#8221; neighborhood outside of the center. A review is forthcoming; keep an eye out for the comparison.</p>
